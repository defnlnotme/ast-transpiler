Objective:
Develop a TypeScript to Julia transpiler.

Current Work:
The ongoing project is located in src/juliaTranspilerDS.ts.

Example Reference:
Use src/pythonTranspiler.ts as a reference for building the transpiler.

Testing Strategy:

    Address test failures incrementally in tests/juliaTranspiler.test.ts.
    Execute tests using npm test -- --bail.
    Run individual tests by modifying the test file and adding .only(...) to the test in question.

Scope of Work:
Only modify the file src/juliaTranspilerDS.ts to resolve test issues.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency, guiding developers to utilize existing resources effectively while maintaining focus on the project's goals.
